It\u2019s important to ensure that all products can be used as intended and that end users understand the interface and can get the outcome they need easily. This guide contains clear and consistent guidelines on core design elements, including colour palettes, typography, and layout structures. You will also find screengrabs of templates with annotations to explain which components to use. Top five things to consider 1.Core colours: NHS blue - Hex 005EB8 Use this for logos, straps White - Hex ffffff Use this for labels on buttons, NHS logo, headings on NHS blue 2. Font \u2022 The FDP uses type sizes Small, Medium and Large. We believe that the \u201csmall\u201d size is unreadable for many users, therefore would recommend only using Medium and Large \u2022 Optimal default paragraph font size for maximum readability for most users is 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens. Font size should not be smaller than size 10px. 3. Using colours \u2022 Users think that when colour is used it is trying to convey information, so make sure the use of colour is intentional and consistent. Don't use colour just for decoration. \u2022 Follow the colour guidance below to ensure consistent experience for users across all products \u2022 A proportion of users cannot differentiate different colours. To communicate with people who cannot see well or distinguish colours, you may need to: Ensure that the contrast between colours is high enough using a colour tool Word things differently Use more than one visual cue, for example, text and an icon as well as colour 4. Headings \u2022 Make them meaningful, let readers know where they are/ what they are looking at \u2022 Use \u201cSentence Case\u201d for headings \u2022 Make proper use of H1-H6 (Semantic page structure) 5. Links \u2022 Links should open in the same window. There are 2 exceptions to this: for instructions or other help with filling in a form (for example, a date picker) if a user has logged into a secure site and the link would take them away from it \u2022 Make links meaningful, do not say \u201cclick here\u201d. Provide context where it will take the user \u2022 When a link will open a new tab for the user, add the words \u201copens in new tab\u201d (or window) to the line Guidance on use of colour \u2022 Users find colours indicative of meaning, therefore, we need to use colour intentionally, for specific actions and consistently \u2022 Make sure that what the colour is \"saying\" is available in other ways. To communicate with people who cannot see well or distinguish colours, you may need to: \u2022 word things differently \u2022 use more than one visual cue, for example, text and an icon as well as colour NHS Colour Palette Core colours NHS blue - HEX 005EB8 White - HEX FFFFFF Buttons Button colour - HEX 007F3B Secondary button colour - HEX 4C6272 Font colour - HEX FFFFFF Background NHS blue-grey background Background - HEX F0F4F5 Error state Error colour - HEX D5281B Link colours Link colour - HEX 005EB8 Hover link colour - HEX 7C2855 Visited link colour - HEX330072 Active link colour - HEX 002F5C Border Border colour - HEX D8DDE0 Form border colour - HEX 4C6272 Written Content Readability \u2022 Aim to write for a reading age of 9 to 11 years old (*explain why) \u2022 Use plain language, spell out abbreviations and acronyms when first used \u2022 Don\u2019t use jargon, rather than saying \u2018free text\u2019 say \u2018notes\u2019 \u2022 Use short sentences \u2022 Avoid long paragraphs \u2022 Write descriptive headings and subheadings \u2022 Do not assume our audience will be familiar with the topic Tone of voice \u2022 Use the active voice \u2022 There\u2019s usually no need to say \"please\" or \"please note\" \u2022 There\u2019s usually no need to say thank you \u2022 Say \"sorry\" if something serious has gone wrong - for example, the service has stopped working completely Numbers in data \u2022 We use numerals for numbers (including 1 and 2) \u2022 For numbers over 999, use a comma for clarity \u2013 for example, 1,000 \u2022 Always start with zero for values less than 1 (Example: 0.75 not .75) \u2022 Ensure negative values are indicated by a minus sign (Example: -65) \u2022 Percentages shouldn't be at a greater detail than 1decimal place unless specifically required \u2022 We spell out \"one\" when it means \"a\" or to avoid repeating a word \u2022 For further content guidance (opens in a new window) Date and time Dates \u2022 Always use UK format for dates, do not use American format \u2022 Use this format for dates: 6 August 2018 \u2022 If you need to include the day of the week, use this format: Wednesday 6 August 2018 \u2022 short dates should be formatted DD/MM/YYYY Time \u2022 \"5:30pm\", not \"1730hrs\" \u2022 \"midnight\" not \"00:00\" \u2022 \"midday\" not \"12 noon\", \"noon\" or \"12pm\" \u2022 \"6 hours 30 minutes\", not \"6.5hrs\" Images Informative images \u2022 Do not use text in images \u2022 Provide alt-text when images convey meaning or information.
